![home-page](static/documents/screenshots/Home.png)


As the name suggests, Parentingram is a community platform designed for parents. Itâ€™s a place where parents can come together to share ideas, tips, and experiences related to parenting. You can find a variety of content, including healthy recipes, lunch ideas, educational posts, activity sheets, and information about local events and sports.
The platform also allows you to engage with other parents by commenting on posts and expressing your likes and dislikes.

## UX

The design philosophy was to create a simple blog where users can view posts and comment on other posts. A user can view a post, open it, and read its content. A user can create their own post if they are logged in, and they can also update or delete their own posts.
Users can comment on other posts if they are logged in, and they can update or delete their own comments as well.
Once a user comments on a post, a message will appear indicating that the comment is awaiting approval. Other users can only see the comment. Once an admin approves the comment, everyone can view it.
A user can like or dislike a post as well, once they are logged in.

### Colour Scheme


The color scheme uses bright full of life colors like(pink, orange, red, white and black color for footer) which is present throughout the site.


I used a bootstrap template to bring colors to my website which is linked below:

## Agile methodologies:

Following Agile methodology, I issued user stories and added them to my project.

[project](https://github.com/users/raheelaahmed/projects/4).


## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on Heroku. You can find it [here](https://parentigram-0cf4fc00ca66.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database.


1. Open the link provided by Code Institute: [PostgreSQL](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/).
2. Enter the email address connected to Code Institute.
3. You will receive your database information in your email.
4. Copy the code and add it to your `env.py` file.
5. You can add the database information to your `settings.py` file.
6. Create a superuser and use the database.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/raheelaahmed/parentingram/tree/main) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- [`git clone'](https://github.com/raheelaahmed/parentingram.git)
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.



#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/raheelaahmed/parentingram/tree/main)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
