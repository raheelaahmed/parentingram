# Parentingram 

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)


Parentigram is community plateforrm for parents.

## UX

The design philosophy was to create a simple, minimalistic look, which would be in stark contrast to the many cluttered and confusing sports club websites that the user will have undoubtedly come across. Relevant information is presented in a salient and refreshingly clean manner, allowing the user to easily and pleasingly navigate through the site.

### Colour Scheme


The color scheme uses soft white and grey colors, with a strong "tennis style" dark-green accent which is present throughout the site.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-333333-a1a1a1-f5f5f5-ffffff-507e50-507948-304f2a-263e21) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for the primary headers, titles, and text content.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

All user stories can be found in a linked GitHub project [here](https://github.com/users/raheelaahmed/projects/4)
